# MyHappyBunch

### E2E Cypress

- runs well locally in both dev/prod modes.
- Important to note: in CI pipeline run by gh actions, it randomly fails with visiting the page url, (see below)
  so far - the only remedy found is to clear cache and re-run the gh workflow jobs

```yaml
  Running:  app.cy.ts                                                                       (1 of 1)

  1) my-happy-bunch-e2e
       "before each" hook for "should display welcome message":
     CypressError: `cy.visit()` failed trying to load:

http://localhost:3000/

The response we received from your web server was:

  > 404: Not Found

This was considered a failure because the status code was not `2xx`.

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application

Run `npx nx dev my-happy-bunch` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build my-happy-bunch` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
